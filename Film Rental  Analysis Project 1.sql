# INTRODUCING THE PROJECT
/*  THE SITUATION
The company’s insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company’s underwriters
need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy. 

THE OBJECTIVE
Use MySQL to: Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer the underwriters’ questions. Each question can be answered
by querying just one table. Part of your job as an Analyst is figuring out which table to use.*/
